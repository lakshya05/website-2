Make new pages by adding `.md` files to this folder or subfolders.
The pages should start with a layout and title block:

```
---
layout: default
title: Help
---
```

And then you can add your page content in [Markdown
format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can edit the sidebar in `_includes/sidebar.md` or (advanced!) the
layout in `_layouts/default.html`.
